# Project Description

This project combines web and mobile app development to create a comprehensive platform using technologies such as Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Flutter.

## Web Development:

### Development Environment Setup:

- Install Node.js and MongoDB.
- Set up a Node.js project and initialize npm.
- Install necessary packages like Express and MongoDB driver.

### Frontend Implementation:

- Design the website layout using HTML and CSS.
- Implement interactive features using JavaScript, including adding items to favorites and signup/sign-in functionality.

### Backend Setup and Implementation:

- Create a MongoDB database and collection for user data storage.
- Connect the Node.js application to MongoDB using the MongoDB driver or Mongoose.
